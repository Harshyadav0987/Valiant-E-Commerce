🛒 Valiant — Production-Style E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack e-commerce application built with a production mindset, focusing on scalability, performance, and real-world workflows such as authentication, payments, caching, and admin operations.

This project is not a toy CRUD app — it simulates how a real online store works end-to-end.
